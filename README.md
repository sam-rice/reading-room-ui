### Abstract

Reading Room is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse and catalogue a virtual library of books. New users can be registered, authenticated, and create custom "shelves"â€”individual collections of books. Books with corresponding user notes can then be edited or added/removed from each shelf. Within the "browse" section of the app, users can search for new books by title or author name.

The app's target users are modern book-lovers who need an instant, mobile way to search for new books and keep track of thier book collections.

All data is served up via a Java/Spring Boot [back-end service](https://github.com/sam-rice/reading-room-api), which leverages the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) for book and author data.
